# Welcome to ethblog

It has been become clear to me through recent exploration that a more spicy, aligned forum is needed to share my deepest takes.

Welcome to ethblog. An attempt to free ourselves from the mind prison that is discourse controlled on a few sets of fragile, centralized, spammed forums, or the algorithm-sorted and low quality feeds controlled by centralized corporations.

ethblog is an opinionated blog platform. it is built with the following in mind:

1. **security** - all code is minimal and makes use of no libraries whenever possible. all code is designed to be simple, modular, and hand-auditable. input is escaped and served in a very limited markdown format to prevent browser vulnerabilities. there is only one substantial file required to read ethblog, and about 200 total lines of code.
2. **freedom** - ethblog is proudly licensed GPLv3. we believe there is no compromising on freedom.
3. **usability** - our readme and docs will provide simple access to both reading ethblog websites and publishing them.
4. **durability** - we choose L1 for its eternal durability. these are important discussions we are having today, and should be archived for future study.
5. **respect** - by having creators pay on-chain gas prices per word, posts published on ethblog respect the time of you, the reader.


Why don't you join us in publishing your thoughts into our shared blockchain record? Let's put our money where our mouth is and replace centralization with decentralization, not tomorrow but today.
