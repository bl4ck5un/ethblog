# Welcome to hackingdecentralized

Many boring research blogs already exist — I certainly don't want to add another one.

This one, at least, runs on Ethereum, so its mere existence is a bit more exciting.

Hopefully, the content will be exciting too. :)

Based on Phil’s ethblog — love the idea!

The title — hackingdecentralized — pays homage to the now-defunct Hacking Distributed blog.
